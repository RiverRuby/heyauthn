# heyauthn

A PoC for a WebAuthn-based flow to join anonymous Semaphore groups. Essentially using WebAuthn as a cross-device wallet for your Semaphore identities in a way that is more convenient and secure than a password manager. Integrated with IYK's NFC devices to make creating in-person groups smoother than the individual QR codes used at Devcon's TAZ.

The end goal is to clean up this repo and set up a well-documented and well-organized starter repo for future message-board style apps. WebAuthn's biometric based authentication is smoother and more secure than localStorage, chrome extensions, or password manager based solutions.
